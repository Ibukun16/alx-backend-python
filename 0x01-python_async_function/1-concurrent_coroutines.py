A function that import wait_random from previous python file that was
written and write an async routine called wait_n that takes in 2 int
arguments (in this order): n and max_delay. You will spawn wait_random
n times with the specified max_delay.

wait_n to return the list of all the delays (float values).
The list of the delays should be in ascending order without using sort()
because of concurrency.
